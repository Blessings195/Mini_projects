# Patient Recovery Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing patient recovery data using Python.  
The objective is to understand infection and recovery trends based on age and region by performing data cleaning, feature engineering, aggregation, and visualization.

The analysis helps identify regions with the highest number of recovered cases and compares recovery rates across different regions.

## Dataset
- **File:** patient.csv  
- The dataset contains patient-related information such as:
  - Patient ID  
  - Region  
  - Sex  
  - Birth year  
  - Confirmed date  
  - Released (or recovery) date  

Missing values were handled appropriately, and new features were created to support meaningful analysis.

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values  
- Conversion of date columns to datetime format  
- Feature engineering (age calculation, recovered status)  
- Regional aggregation of confirmed and recovered cases  
- Calculation of recovery rates by region  
- Visualization of confirmed vs recovered cases
